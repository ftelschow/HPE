# HPE
This repository implements the bootstrapped Hermite Projection estimator
and other estimators for Lipschitz Killing curvatures of random fields.
Moreover, it reproduces the simulation results and data analysis from
https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02493.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This git-repository implements and aims to reproduce the
simulation results and data analysis from "Estimation of Expected Euler
Characteristic Curves of Nonstationary Smooth Gaussian Random Fields" (Telschow et al)
using Matlab.

These estimators will be soon included into the RFTtoolbox https://github.com/sjdavenport/RFTtoolbox,
such that the latter Toolbox should be used for future research, since we will keep only the RFTtoolbox
fully up-to-date in the future and new developements will appear there. Please cite that Toolbox appropriately,
in case you are using our work.
